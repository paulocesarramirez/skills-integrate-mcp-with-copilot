Subject: LaTeX Artifact Rendering Issue with Online Image URLs

Dear xAI Support Team,

I encountered an issue while rendering a LaTeX artifact generated by Grok in Visual Studio Code (or xAI’s UI). The file fails to open with the error: "We can't open this file - Something went wrong" when including an online image URL in the `\includegraphics` command.

**Details**:
- **Environment**: Visual Studio Code with LaTeX Workshop extension (or specify xAI’s UI if applicable).
- **Artifact**: LaTeX file (`paulo-profile.tex`) with `\includegraphics{https://static.wixstatic.com/media/89ac89_68213d5342ab4e828fc55bcba5ad8a50~mv2.jpg}`.
- **Issue**: Rendering fails when the image URL is included. Removing the `\includegraphics` command resolves the issue, confirming the image URL as the cause.
- **Expected Behavior**: LaTeX should fetch and render the online image or provide a clear error message.
- **Steps to Reproduce**:
  1. Generate a LaTeX artifact with `\includegraphics{<online_URL>}` (e.g., the URL above).
  2. Attempt to compile the file to PDF in VS Code or xAI’s UI.
  3. Observe the error: "We can't open this file - Something went wrong."
- **Suggested Fix**: Support HTTP image URLs in `graphicx` or clarify in documentation that local images are required.

**Environment Details**:
- OS: [e.g., Windows 11, macOS Ventura]
- VS Code Version: [e.g., 1.85]
- LaTeX Extension: [e.g., LaTeX Workshop v9.0]
- Date: July 23, 2025

Please let me know if you need additional logs or details. This is critical for my workshops, as I rely on professional PDF outputs.
